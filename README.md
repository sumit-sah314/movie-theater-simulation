# Movie Theater Simulation

This repository contains a C++ program that simulates the operations of a movie theater, including customer membership management and theater seating arrangements. The program also includes a grading driver to test the functionality.

This project was developed as part of a programming assignment for my first semester at Texas State University, supervised by Professor David Patrick.

## Features
- Manage customer membership and seating.
- Simulate various scenarios based on input files.
- Includes test cases and a grading driver.

## File Structure
- `movie_simulation_program_3.cpp`: Main program file.
- `movie_simulation_program_3_functions.cpp`: Contains functions used in the main program.
- `movie_simulation_program_3.h`: Header file for the program.
- `movie_simulation_grading_driver.cpp`: Grading driver for testing the program.
- `Makefile`: Instructions to compile the program.
- `*.txt`: Input files for simulation.
- `*.out`: Output files generated during testing.

## Compilation and Execution
1. **Compile the program** using the Makefile:
   ```bash
   make
